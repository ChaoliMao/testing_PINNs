# testing_PINNs
In the context of my Master Thesis I am testing the PINNs algorithm to infer hidden parameters in PDEs using neural networks.

The PDEs are:
* An advection-diffusion equation
* A diffusion equation with nonlinear source
* The Burgers equation


The PINNs algorithm was developed by Maziar Raissi, Paris Perdikaris, and George Em Karniadakis. It is described in (https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/) and their paper 'Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part II): Data-driven Discovery of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10566.pdf).
